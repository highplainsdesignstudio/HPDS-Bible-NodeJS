# HPDS Bible API App

A REST api that parses through various translations of the Bible. 

## Project Status

V1.0.0 is a rough application that displays chapters of the Bible as a user selects them.
The main focus of the project to this point has been to port various copies of the Bible from a CSV 
format into a JSON format. After the port, a quick and simple front end was written to get the project
to its next phase.

The goal is to create an api with various calls capable of traversing the Bible. This api will be 
used for further applications.  


### Prerequisites

Gulp.js and Node.js are required to build and run this application.

### Installation
Installs from command line. Git clone or download and unzip the files.
